## Determine workload requirements (10-15%)

### Gather Information and Requirements
+ [identify compliance requirements, identity and access management infrastructure, and
service-oriented architectures (e.g., integration patterns, service design, service
discoverability]()
+ [identify accessibility (e.g. Web Content Accessibility Guidelines), availability (e.g. Service
Level Agreement), capacity planning and scalability, deploy-ability (e.g., repositories,
failback, slot-based deployment), configurability, governance, maintainability (e.g.
logging, debugging, troubleshooting, recovery, training), security (e.g. authentication,
authorization, attacks), and sizing (e.g. support costs, optimization) requirements]()
+ [recommend changes during project execution (ongoing)]()
+ [evaluate products and services to align with solution]()
+ [create testing scenarios]()

### Optimize Consumption Strategy
+[optimize app service, compute, identity, network, and storage costs]()

### Design an Auditing and Monitoring Strategy

+ [define logical groupings (tags) for resources to be monitored]()
+ [determine levels and storage locations for logs]()
+ [plan for integration with monitoring tools]()
+ [recommend appropriate monitoring tool(s) for a solution]()
+ [specify mechanism for event routing and escalation]()
+ [design auditing for compliance requirements]()
+ [design auditing policies and traceability requirements]()

## Design for identity and security (20-25%)

### Design Identity Management
+ [choose an identity management approach]()
+ [design an identity delegation strategy, identity repository (including directory,
application, systems, etc.]()
+ [design self-service identity management and user and persona provisioning]()
+ [define personas and roles]()
+ [recommend appropriate access control strategy (e.g., attribute-based, discretionary
access, history-based, identity-based, mandatory, organization-based, role-based, rulebased, responsibility-based)]()

### Design Authentication
+ [choose an authentication approach]()
+ [design a single-sign on approach]()
+ [design for IPSec, logon, multi-factor, network access, and remote authentication]()

### Design Authorization
+ [choose an authorization approach]()
+ [define access permissions and privileges]()
+ [design secure delegated access (e.g., oAuth, OpenID, etc.)]()
+ [recommend when and how to use API Keys]()

### Design for Risk Prevention for Identity
+ [design a risk assessment strategy (e.g., access reviews, RBAC policies, physical access)]()
+ [evaluate agreements involving services or products from vendors and contractors]()
+ [update solution design to address and mitigate changes to existing security policies,
standards, guidelines and procedures]()

### Design a Monitoring Strategy for Identity and Security
+ [design for alert notifications]()
+ [design an alert and metrics strategy]()
+ [recommend authentication monitors]()
